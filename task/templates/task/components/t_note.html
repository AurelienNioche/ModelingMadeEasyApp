        Instruction: In the model test, we have tried to build the linear regression model with independent variables:
        Height (X1) Weight (X2) and Hair Length (X3).
        The idea is similar in this experiment. You will construct a linear regression
        model given 8 independent variables. You could explore them with the left two blocks, and study linear
        regression modeling with the Tutorial Material. Eventually, you would need to choose the variables
        that you'd like to include in this model and sumbit it. Good luck!
