            <b>Instructions:</b> In the model test, we have tried to build the linear regression model with independent variables:
            Height (<i>X1</i>) Weight (<i>X2</i>) and Hair Length (<i>X3</i>).
            The idea is similar in this experiment. You will construct a linear regression
            model given 8 independent variables. You could explore them with the left two blocks, and study linear
            regression modeling with the Tutorial Material.
            {% if group_id > 0 %}
                <b>AI system can assist you in constructing the model.</b>
            {%  endif %}
            Eventually, you would need to choose the variables
            that you would like to include/exclude in this model and submit it. Good luck!
